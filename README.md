# College Academic Planner - My Bachelor's Capstone Project (.NET MAUI)

## Description

This repository contains the source code for the College Academic Planner, a significant project that served as my capstone for my Bachelor's degree. Developed using the **.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI)** framework, this application represents the culmination of my undergraduate studies, allowing me to integrate and apply the theoretical knowledge and practical skills I gained in software engineering, cross-platform development, and project management. The College Academic Planner is designed to be a practical tool for college students, aiming to simplify the organization of their academic lives by providing features for managing courses, tracking assignments and exams, recording grades, and visualizing their schedules across different devices.

## Features

The College Academic Planner is built with the needs of college students in mind and leverages the capabilities of .NET MAUI to offer a cross-platform solution. Its key features include:

* **Comprehensive Course Management:** Users can add, modify, and remove course details, including names, codes, credit hours, instructor information, and scheduled meeting times.
* **Assignment and Exam Tracking:** The application facilitates the recording of all academic tasks, allowing users to set due dates, add descriptions, and update their completion status.
* **Grade Input and Analysis:** A core feature is the ability to input grades for various assignments and exams, with the potential for calculating course averages and overall academic performance (depending on the implemented calculation logic).
* **Intuitive Schedule Visualization:** Provides a clear visual representation of the student's weekly or daily schedule, helping them keep track of classes, study sessions, and other commitments on their preferred device.
* **Integrated Event Management:** Beyond coursework, the planner allows users to add and manage other important academic or personal events, offering a single point of reference for all time commitments.
* **Attendance Tracking:** (If implemented) Functionality to monitor class attendance.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** (Leveraging MAUI) Designed to run on multiple operating systems (Windows, Android, iOS, macOS) from a single codebase.
